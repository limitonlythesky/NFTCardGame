# General Info
This project was made following a tutorial from JavaScript Mastery. 
This is a card game where each card is a Game Token that has levels of attack and defense.
With their own deck, each person will be able to enter the game and create a battlefield that another player can join. 
During combat, you have two options: defense and attack. 
The fight continues until someone gives up or loses.
